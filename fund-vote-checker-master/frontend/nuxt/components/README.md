# COMPONENTS

The components directory contains our Vue.js Components.

Best practice is: 
1. To use multiple word names for components and sort these words by specificity from the most general to most specific:
2. Use PascalCase for the name.
  

Example: 

**A grouped bar chart** 
You could sort it like this
1. Chart (because there will be probably several charts in this project), 
2. Bar (type of chart), 
3. Grouped (subtype of bar charts)

Result:
> ChartBarGrouped.vue
